<main class="about"><div class="container aboutInerr"><div class="aboutContent"><p class="aboutContentText">George (Gia) Japaridze (born May 5, 1945), is a merited Georgian sculptor and artist. Born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia, Mr. Japaridze became interested in art and sculpting at an early age and took classes through grade school at the “Pioneers Palace”. He entered the Tbilisi State Academy of Fine Arts in 1962 and upon graduation in 1968 was selected as the Best Student. He continued studying at the Post-Graduate Department and served on the faculty until 1972. He was then honored to become a member of the union of Artists of the U.S.S.R.<br><br>
The diversity and variety of his work, including large bronze sculptures erected in Georgia,Russia, Italy, USA, the Netherlands and Azerbaijan, as well as small bronze, copper and brass statues created by using different styles and techniques- plasticine and clay, toreutics, blacksmith and goldsmith crafts, paintings and drawings –his work is undoubtedly speaking not only about the great talent with deeply refined taste and educated and sharp mind, but also mere quantity of the artwork is surprising and speaks of his love and dedication to his craft.<br><br>
He does not confine himself to one genre or style only, and does not avoid abstraction, allegory, or even symbolism. Where does he get his inspiration, how can he be so classic like old masters and so ardently modern, abstract, poetic and realistic at the same time. The art collectors with the most refined taste have long appreciated his works-smaller sculptures and drawings appear in permanent collections of a number of international museums and private collections all over the world, including Georgia, Russia, Italy, Netherlands, Azerbaijan, the USA, France, Spain, Moldova, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, etc… Art pieces can be seen in private collections of Juan Carlos I of Spain, Mr. Jimmy Carter, former President of the USA, Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch, Former president of FIFA, Mr. Richard H. Matzke, President of Chevron Corporation, Pope John Paul II to name a few.</p></div><div class="aboutImg"></div></div></main>
